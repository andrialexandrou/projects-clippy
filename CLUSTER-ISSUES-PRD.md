# Product Requirements Document: Issue Clustering Tool

## Overview

The Issue Clustering Tool is a command-line utility that uses AI-powered clustering to organize GitHub issues into logical groups based on solution patterns. It helps engineering teams identify related issues that can be solved together, making prioritization and work planning more efficient.

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams often face a large backlog of issues without clear organization. This makes it difficult to:

1. Identify patterns and common problems
2. Prioritize effectively
3. Group related work for more efficient resolution
4. Understand the overall distribution of issues across the codebase

Manual categorization is time-consuming and often inconsistent. An automated solution that intelligently groups issues by how they could be solved would significantly improve planning efficiency.

## Target Users

- Engineering managers and technical leads
- Product managers
- Developers planning their sprint work
- Triage teams

## Core Requirements

### Input Handling

- The tool must accept a JSON file containing GitHub issues as input
- Each issue must be processed with its full metadata (title, body, labels, etc.)
- The tool should handle large input files with hundreds or thousands of issues

### Clustering Functionality

- Use AI (OpenAI API) to group issues based on solution patterns
- Create meaningful cluster names that describe the type of work involved
- Process issues in batches to handle large datasets efficiently
- Support hierarchical clustering with nested subclusters for large groups
- Identify and group uncategorized issues

### Output and Reporting

- Generate a structured JSON output with clear clustering information
- Provide intermediate outputs to show the clustering process
- Include statistics about clusters (counts, sizes, distribution)
- Create comprehensive logs for troubleshooting and tracking

### Performance and Scalability

- Process at least 1,000 issues within a reasonable time frame
- Support configurable batch sizes to optimize API usage
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- Support resumable operation in case of interruption

## User Experience Requirements

- Provide clear console output indicating progress
- Generate a detailed log file for debugging and analysis
- Support customization through command-line options
- Produce human-readable outputs that can be shared with stakeholders

## Technical Requirements

- Written in CoffeeScript for maintainability
- Deployable on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Minimal external dependencies
- Configurable for different AI models and settings

## Success Metrics

1. Cluster quality: Issues in the same cluster should genuinely share solution patterns
2. Appropriate cluster granularity: Clusters should contain 5-10 issues on average
3. Comprehensive coverage: At least 90% of issues should be assigned to meaningful clusters
4. Processing efficiency: Handle 1,000 issues in under 30 minutes with standard settings

## Future Enhancements

- Interactive web UI for visualizing and manually refining clusters
- Integration with GitHub and JIRA APIs for direct issue fetching
- Support for custom clustering algorithms beyond OpenAI
- Automated label suggestions based on clusters
- Cluster visualization and reporting tools
- Integration with sprint planning tools
